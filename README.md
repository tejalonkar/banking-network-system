IoT-Integrated Banking Network System with Secure Vault , DHCP, and  Topological Optimization for Enhanced Efficiency and Security

Introduction
With the integration of IoT in banking, a network system that securely connects various smart devices while managing data with agility has become crucial.
This project focuses on developing a banking network system that employs IoT devices, a vault for secure storage, and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) for seamless device connectivity.
The system’s architecture is designed to support various network topologies to enhance resilience and security.

Objective
This project aims to design an IoT-enabled banking network that ensures efficient management of smart devices.
The objectives include:

Implementing a vault for secure access

Deploying DHCP for dynamic IP management

Exploring different network topologies to find the optimal configuration for performance and security

Methodology
The system architecture includes IoT-enabled devices such as smart cameras and sensors for security monitoring, and data-logging systems.
DHCP manages IP allocation dynamically to accommodate changing network needs.
The system explores various topologies—such as mesh, tree, and hybrid—to optimize performance, based on factors like device count, network traffic, and data security.
Extensive testing in a simulated environment assesses the system’s reliability, response time, and security.

To ensure secure access to the bank vault, the vault door is equipped with an RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) reader, which restricts entry exclusively to authorized bank personnel.
Authorized members are issued RFID-enabled identification cards that contain unique codes.
When an individual with permission to access the vault approaches the door, they must scan their RFID card on the reader.

Results
The implemented network system demonstrated effective IP management with DHCP, significantly reducing manual configuration time.
The IoT devices enhanced real-time monitoring capabilities.
Among tested topologies, the hybrid configuration proved optimal, balancing network efficiency and fault tolerance, which is essential in banking.

Conclusion
This IoT-integrated banking network system showcases a secure, scalable, and efficient solution for modern banking operations.
The inclusion of DHCP for dynamic management, a vault for security, and a resilient hybrid topology addresses the evolving demands of the banking sector.
